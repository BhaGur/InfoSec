# Week 1 assignment

## Summary of Kill chain model
* Threats to computer networks have existed since the network have existed. But the class of threat has advanced and the risk has also increased. Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) intrusions pose risk to big organizations as well as the national security.
*	Conventional technology are not sufficient to prevent the intrusions posed by the APT. The APT are able to evade firewall and anti-viruses and attack even government networks and steal classified information.
*	US government along with other security organizations worked on building infrastructure and models to counter the threat of APT.
*	Kill chain is a unique model developed to find, fix, kill, track, target, engage and assess the threat. The framework is based on defensive and countermeasure strategies used by the US Army.
*	Intelligence-driven computer network defense addresses the threat of intrusion kill chain model to analyze intrusions and drive defensive course of action.
*	All the component of the kill chain model must work in order to work effectively. This is an end-to-end process and any deficiency in one process will interrupt the whole process.
*	Kill chain phases with respect to computer network attack (CNA) includes reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control, and action on objectives.
*	The defender’s primary goal is to prevent the threat from adversaries and adapt to their operations. The defensive strategies is based on the repeated indicators and defenders uses these repetition to improve defensive strategy and make it more difficult for adversaries to achieve their objectives.
*	Multiple intrusions kill chains help to analyze and identify commonalities and indicators of attacks and help defenders to recognize and prioritize development and use of course of action.
*	The use of threat component of risk to build resilience against APTs decreases the adversary’s likelihood of success.  

## Command line revisited
I learned the command line during the server technology course. I have used it during the course but as the course was not intensive, I used the basic command line in the course. The article Command Line Basics Revisited helped me to refresh the command lines.
Some of the basic commands are as follows:
*	$ pwd prints the working directory
*	$ls prints the list of working directory

## Bandit oh-five
I solved the first five levels of the over the wire: Bandit. The tasks were not that difficult as the commands used for the first five tasks were what I have used previously. Below are some of the screenshots that I saved while completing the tasks.

## Hacker warmup
The tasks on WebGoat were a bit difficult to complete. It was difficult to find answer for some of the questions. Below are the screenshots that I took while completing the tasks.
