This file contains the task related to the week 5 of the Information security Course. This week we learned about passwrod manager and Encrypting and decrypting message.

## The use of a password manager
* First of all I installed password manager ‘pass’ in my Debian using the following as shown in the image below.

* After installation, I initialized the password store with the code as in the image below. The code consisted of the ID of my GPG key. It created a directory and the password store was initialized.

* Then, I generated a GPG key using the command gpg –generate-key. This prompted me to type my Real name and email. After that a popup appeared that asked me to put in a passphrase. The passphrase is used as a master key.

* The password generated can be stored in a separate file. I generated password as shown in the first line of the image for linked.com. The 12 at the end of the line represents the number of characters I want in the password. Once the password is created, I can retrieve the password with the command pass -c website/linked.com. The password will be copied for 45 seconds.

* The list of passwords can be checked with the command pass which shows you all the folders which you have saved the password in.
