This file contains the task related to the week 5 of the Information security Course. This week we learned about passwrod manager and Encrypting and decrypting message.

## Password manager
For this part of the task, I had to choose a password manager and explain about the basic information about the password manager. I chose Bitwarden and below are few information that I was able to find about the password manager.
*	Bitwarden is an open-source password management service that provides a password generator, credential sharing in an encrypted vault and the option to self-host.
*	Bitwarden provides the services free of cost. Customers also have option to upgrade to Premium tier with a fee.
*	Bitwarden offers web interface, desktop applications, browser extensions, mobile apps and command-line interface.
*	Bitwarden helps us to generate a default password containing all the required characters and save them in the vault. Customers can also create their own password and save them. If the password is weak or has been reused, Bitwarden will notify customer about the issue.
*	Bitwarden also generates report about exposed passwords that have been uncovered in known data breaches. If there has been data breaches, Bitwarden checks if your data has been breached via sites such as ‘Have I Been Pwned’.
*	Password thus created are encrypted and saved in the vault as Zero-knowledge encryption i.e., the data is only accessible to the owner and not to the service provider.
*	End-to-end encryption keeps the messages secure and can be only read by the users.
*	Bitwarden have two tiers of licensing for the software. For the clients, the core password management code is under the GPL 3.0 license. The server code is licensed under AGPL 3.0 license.
*	Bitwarden processes and store the encrypted data in the Microsoft Azure cloud in the USA managed by the team at Microsoft.
*	Data can be stored locally in our own device and only be decrypted when you unlock the vault. Decrypted data is stored in memory and never written to persistent storage.
*	The encrypted data is stored at the following locations at rest:
*	The data saved in the vault is encrypted and can only be decrypted by the owner. Not even Bitwarden can access the data stored.
*	Even if due to some reason Bitwarden is hacked, the data is still protected due to strong encryption and one-way salted hashing measures taken on vault data and master password.

## The use of a password manager
* First of all I installed password manager ‘pass’ in my Debian using the following as shown in the image below.

* After installation, I initialized the password store with the code as in the image below. The code consisted of the ID of my GPG key. It created a directory and the password store was initialized.

* Then, I generated a GPG key using the command gpg –generate-key. This prompted me to type my Real name and email. After that a popup appeared that asked me to put in a passphrase. The passphrase is used as a master key.

* The password generated can be stored in a separate file. I generated password as shown in the first line of the image for linked.com. The 12 at the end of the line represents the number of characters I want in the password. Once the password is created, I can retrieve the password with the command pass -c website/linked.com. The password will be copied for 45 seconds.

* The list of passwords can be checked with the command pass which shows you all the folders which you have saved the password in.
