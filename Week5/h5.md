This file contains the task related to the week 5 of the Information security Course. This week we learned about password manager and Encrypting and decrypting message. For the first part of the assignment, I had to summarise Chapter 10 (Using Algorithms) from the book Applied Cryptography by Scheiner (2015). Second part of the assignment required me to give some information about a password manager. I searched for information about Bitwarden, a password manager and reported some information about it below. In the third part, I have exlplained to encrypt and decrypt password using 'pass' in debian. The fourth part has explaination about encrypting and decrypting message using gpg in debian.

## Using Algorithms
* Any kind of a security is a chain and for the security to be strong all the links must be strong and secure. Attacker will attack the weakest link to break the chain and unfortunately break the security chain an the system is breached.
* Cryptography is only a small part of security and is about making a system secure.
* Cryptography nowadays is not about just protecting the national security system but individual data such as bank cards, lottery terminals, prepayment electricity meters.
* Most of the failure in cryptography is not because of the algorithms or protocols but because of failures in implementation and human errors. 
### 10.1 Choosing and algorithm
* Many factors come into play while evaluating and choosing algorithms. People choose certain algorithms because it has not been broken yet, trust of the manufacturer, trust of the government or they build their own algorithms based on their belief they trust no one else.
* But all these factors are problematic as it is not good idea to trust a manufacturer or the government or even build your own algorithms without any knowledge.
* NSA (national security agency) have some of the best cryptographers and it is an easy task for them to decrypt any hard drive. NSA does not however publicly admit they can decrypt the file or message.
* Any algorithms that has to be exported out of US needs to be approved by NSA. These exports are dumbed down or encrypted with a fixed header at the beginning of each message to facilitate a known-plaintext attack.
### 10.2 Public-key cryptography vs Symmetric cryptography
* The debate about either public-key cryptography or symmetric cryptography is better does not make sense as they both are used to solve different sort of problems.
* Symmetric cryptography is efficient and is best for encrypting data.
* Public-key cryptography has lengthy message and can do things symmetric cryptography can’t do. It is also best for key management.
### 10.3 Encrypting communicating channels
* When a message is send by the sender, the message can be encrypted at any layer in the OSI. If the encryption takes place at lower layers, it is called link-by-link encryption. If the encryption takes place at higher layer, it is called end-to-end encryption.
* Link-by-link encryption takes place at the physical layer and is easiest to perform. The interfaces are standardized and it is easy to connect hardware devices. The devices encrypt all the data passing through. Storing nodes between the sender and intended receiver needs to decrypt the data stream and process it. This is a very effective encryption method as everything is encrypted and the attacker gets no information about sender or receiver or time or how much information is flowing. Security is simple and does not require any traffic management techniques. A common key is need between the endpoints which can be exchanged independently from the network.

* The advantage of this encryption is that it is easier to operate, only one set of keys per link is required, provides traffic-flow security and encryption is online. However, the only disadvantage is the data is exposed in the intermediate nodes.
* End-to-end encryption puts device between the network and transport layer. The device understands the protocols up to layer three and encrypt only the transport data units. The data units are then sent to lower layers along with unencrypted routing information for transmission. The data/information remains encrypted until it reaches the recipient.
            <img src="https://github.com/BhaGur/InfoSec/blob/main/Week5/end.png" width="500" height="90"> 

* The advantage of this encryption is higher level of secrecy. However, this requires a more complex key-management system since individual users must make sure to have common keys. The routing information is also not encrypted so an attacker might learn about the sender, recipient, and the time of the message transmission.
* Combining the two-encryption method might be expensive but is an effective way of securing a network. Link encryption makes analysis of routing information impossible and end-to-end encryption minimizes the risk of information decryption at different nodes.
### 10.4 Encrypting data for storage
* Data might be stored for later retrieval which will require an encryption key. If a file is encrypted and later cannot be decrypted, we cannot go back and re-encrypt it again. This means the data is lost forever.
* To prevent this, encryption applications should have some mechanisms for unrecoverable errors.
* The key management procedures should assume the encryption key to be used again and again and the data might be idle for long before being decrypted.
* A key in communications link is ideally for the length of the communication while a key for data storage might be needed for longer period of time. Therefore, key management should store this key for longer time.
* Some of the problems regarding encrypting data for storage are that the data might exist in plaintext form which the attacker might exploit by performing known-plaintext attack.
* The speed of input/output device might require encryption hardware for faster encryption and decryption.
* Safe and long term storage for keys is required.
* It is easier to decrypt a file which are not structured. But to decrypt an entire database files will be much difficult and inefficient.
* It is also essential to erase the unencrypted file after encryption.

## Password manager
For this part of the task, I had to choose a password manager and explain about the basic information about the password manager. I chose Bitwarden and below are few information that I was able to find about the password manager.

<img src="https://github.com/BhaGur/InfoSec/blob/main/Week5/bitwarden1.png" width="200" height="90"> 

* Bitwarden is an open-source password management service that provides a password generator, credential sharing in an encrypted vault and the option to self-host.
* Bitwarden provides the services free of cost. Customers also have option to upgrade to Premium tier with a fee.
* Bitwarden offers web interface, desktop applications, browser extensions, mobile apps and command-line interface.
* Bitwarden helps us to generate a default password containing all the required characters and save them in the vault. Customers can also create their own password and save them. If the password is weak or has been reused, Bitwarden will notify customer about the issue.
* Bitwarden also generates report about exposed passwords that have been uncovered in known data breaches. If there has been data breaches, Bitwarden checks if your data has been breached via sites such as ‘Have I Been Pwned’.
* Password thus created are encrypted and saved in the vault as Zero-knowledge encryption i.e., the data is only accessible to the owner and not to the service provider.
* End-to-end encryption keeps the messages secure and can be only read by the users.
* Bitwarden have two tiers of licensing for the software. For the clients, the core password management code is under the GPL 3.0 license. The server code is licensed under AGPL 3.0 license.
* Bitwarden processes and store the encrypted data in the Microsoft Azure cloud in the USA managed by the team at Microsoft.
* Data can be stored locally in our own device and only be decrypted when you unlock the vault. Decrypted data is stored in memory and never written to persistent storage.
* The encrypted data is stored at the following locations at rest:
            <img src="https://github.com/BhaGur/InfoSec/blob/main/Week5/bitwarden2.png" width="550" height="350"> 

* The data saved in the vault is encrypted and can only be decrypted by the owner. Not even Bitwarden can access the data stored.
* Even if due to some reason Bitwarden is hacked, the data is still protected due to strong encryption and one-way salted hashing measures taken on vault data and master password.

## The use of a password manager
* First of all I installed password manager ‘pass’ in my Debian using the following as shown in the image below.
  <img src="https://github.com/BhaGur/InfoSec/blob/main/Week5/password_1.png" width="400" height="150"> 

* After installation, I initialized the password store with the code as in the image below. The code consisted of the ID of my GPG key. It created a directory and the password store was initialized.
  
  <img src="https://github.com/BhaGur/InfoSec/blob/main/Week5/password_2.png" width="500" height="70"> 

* Then, I generated a GPG key using the command gpg –generate-key. This prompted me to type my Real name and email. After that a popup appeared that asked me to put in a passphrase. The passphrase is used as a master key.
  <img src="https://github.com/BhaGur/InfoSec/blob/main/Week5/password_3.png" width="400" height="150"> 

* The password generated can be stored in a separate file. I generated password as shown in the first line of the image for linked.com. The 12 at the end of the line represents the number of characters I want in the password. Once the password is created, I can retrieve the password with the command pass -c website/linked.com. The password will be copied for 45 seconds.

* The list of passwords can be checked with the command pass which shows you all the folders which you have saved the password in.

## Encrypting and Decrypting message with GPG
* First of all, I installed gpg package in the Debian using the following command
                    <img src="https://github.com/BhaGur/InfoSec/blob/main/Week5/encrypt_1.png" width="400" height="70"> 

* Then, I generated the key using the command gpg –generate-key. After the command is entered, I input Real name and an email address. The public and secret key is created as follows.
                    <img src="https://github.com/BhaGur/InfoSec/blob/main/Week5/encrypt_2.png" width="500" height="90"> 

* Then I encrypt the file using the following command. Here I used my own email address as the recipient as the file is only available to me and I will be encrypting the file.
* After encryption I remove the original file and try to open the encrypted file. The following output is shown in the terminal.
* Now, I can decrypt the file with the following code. When I enter the command, A prompt asks me about the passphrase. After I enter my passphrase, the file is decrypted. With the ‘cat’ command now I am able to read the message in the file.
